               <p><b>Course Description:</b>
                The professor was very monotone which made it difficult to focus on the material. Course load was extremely heavy compared to the norm. I would recommend all students not to enroll in this class as an elective.

                Great class! Very informative and the professor articulated the lessons very clearly. I would recommend course to students interested in deepening their knowledge on elements and concepts of Law and Social Justice systems.
