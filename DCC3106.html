                I honestly enjoyed this class. It was really interesting, and I liked the course material. Despite my interest in the class, I did find it difficult to follow along at times since the professor did speak very fast. I would recommend this class to students interested in the topic and would suggest being extremely prepared for the lectures.

                DCC3106, Labour Law was an interesting class. At first, I thought it was very demanding and required a lot of studying, however throughout the semester I released it was manageable. There was 1 midterm, and 2 essays regarding the evolution of business law. I finished the course with an A -.
