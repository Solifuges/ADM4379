                The material was totally foreign to the class, but her classes were enjoyable, she would draw on the board and provide examples, and encouraged participation. Her tests were straightforward (if you studied), and she was always available when needed. Wish I had her for other subjects!

                Amazing class! I learned so much throughout the semester and strongly recommend taking this course. Majority of the deliverables were to be completed in group work. This course had group 5 assignments, 1 midterm, and the final exam.

                I would not recommend this class. The course description was very misleading, and the course load was very heavy. For example, every week, I had over 200 pages to read from the textbook. Also, the professor was quite rude in the way he spoke to students and never answered his emails.
