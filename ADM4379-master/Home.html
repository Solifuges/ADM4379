        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <img src="grouppic.jpg" alt="group picture">
        <p>Our names (from top left on) are Chris, Elie, Josh, Nik, Josh, and Elias. We are fourth year students in the Business Technology Management specialization at the Telfer School of Management. We were brought together on this project for Management and Implementation of Web Technologies in Organizations.</p>
        <p>Our inspiration came from our constant search for electives out of our faculty that we need to graduate. As opposed to scouring the internet for course syllabuses for these courses, we wanted to create a one-stop shop to find the perfect elective for you. That is how What2Take was born!</p>
